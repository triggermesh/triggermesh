# Changes

## 2.1

- Support deleting messages via `client.Messages.Delete(sid)`.

- Support a different default region for local phone number parsing than "US" by
  overriding the value of `twilio.DefaultRegion` in an init function.

Thanks Kevin Golding for the suggestions and issue reports.

## 2.0

Update Pricing API to v2. This is a breaking change.

To upgrade from the v1 Pricing API:

* `VoicePrice` is now `VoicePrices`.
* `VoiceNumberPrice` is now `VoiceNumberPrices`.
* `NumberPrice` is now `NumberPrices`.
* `MessagePrice` is now `MessagePrices`
* The `Prefixes` field in the `PrefixPrice` struct is now `DestinationPrefixes`.
* `OriginationPrefixes` field has been added to the `PrefixPrice` struct.
* The `OutboundCallPrice` field in the `VoiceNumberPrices` struct is now
`OutboundCallPrices`. Add the old `OutboundCallPrice` as the first entry in the
array.
* `OriginationPrefixes` field has been added to the `OutboundCallPrice` struct.

* `NumberVoicePriceService.Get` now has 2 parameters: `destinationNumber` and
`data` url.Values. `destinationNumber` is same as the previous `number` field.
`data` can contain additional parameters like `OriginationNumber`.
* Several other `*PriceService.Get` functions now have a third `url.Values`
  parameter. Pass `nil` for this third parameter to maintain compatibility with
  the v1 API.
