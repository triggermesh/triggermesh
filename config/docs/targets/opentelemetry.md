## Prerequisites

We will use Cortex to configure the OpenTelemetry adapter.

Setup and run [Cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/), for testing purposes set the storage configuration option to `filesystem` and create the rules folder manually.

By default Cortex exposes its API at http://localhost:9009. These are some of the handy endpoints to use when testing this target:

- List all labels http://localhost:9009/api/prom/api/v1/labels
- Query metrics (PromQL) for instrument http://localhost:9009/api/prom/api/v1/query?query=INSTRUMENT-NAME

## Running Locally From Code

The  `./config` directory can be used to deploy the controller and all adapters. Please consult the [development guide](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for information about how to deploy to a cluster.

The adapter code can be run directly from the top-level directory:

```sh
NAMESPACE=default \
K_METRICS_CONFIG={} \
K_LOGGING_CONFIG={} \
OPENTELEMETRY_CORTEX_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9009/api/prom/push \
OPENTELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTS='[
      {"name":"total_requests","instrument":"Counter","number":"Int64","description":"total requests"},
      {"name":"quacking_ducks","instrument":"UpDownCounter","number":"Int64","description":"number of quacking ducks observed"},
      {"name":"request_duration_ms","instrument":"Histogram","number":"Float64","description":"request duration in milliseconds"}
]' \
go run ./cmd/opentelemetrytarget-adapter/main.go
```

Note that several environment variables will need to be set prior to invoking the adapter such as:

  - `NAMESPACE=default`             - To match the one where this adapter is running.
  - `K_LOGGING_CONFIG=''`           - Define the default logging configuration.
  - `K_METRICS_CONFIG='''`          - Define the metrics configuration.
  - `OPENTELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTS`     - OpenTelemetry configured instruments.
  - `OPENTELEMETRY_CORTEX_ENDPOINT` - Cortex endpoint, only when using Cortex .

The endpoint `OPENTELEMETRY_CORTEX_ENDPOINT` must include the path to the Prometheus API push endpoint.
`OPENTELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTS` is a JSON structure that contains an array of instruments, each of them informing:

- `name` for the metric.
- `instrument` kind that can be `Counter`, `UpDownCounter` and `Histogram`.
- `number` that can be `Int64` and `Float`
- `description` is optional.

Tuple `name` and `instrument` must be unique, but it is encouraged that `name` itself is unique to avoid confusions informing metrics.

The `instrument` field choices are missing the asynchronous choices because the adapter is propagating metrics and not creating them. This leaves us with:

- `Counter`: use it when the metric value can only increase, inform the delta at each measurement that will be added to the existing value.
- `UpDownCounter`: use it when the metric can increase and decrease, inform the delta at each measurement that will be added to the existing value.
- `Histogram`: use it when the metric value is not cumulative.

## Running From Kubernetes

TODO

## Accepted CloudEvents

CloudEvents accepted by this Target must be typed:

- `io.triggermesh.opentelemetry.metrics.push`

The expected payload is a JSON array containing:

- `name` for the metric matching a registered instrument at this Target.
- `kind` for the registered instrument is optional when the registered name is unique.
- `value` for the measure. Refer to the instrument registration for the type, `Int64` or `Float64`.
- `attributes` is an optional array that contains:
  - `key` for the attribute.
  - `type` for the value, being one of `string`,`bool`,`int` or `float`
  - `value` for the attribute formatted according to the type.

This is the schema for the description above.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "type": "array",
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "kind": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["Counter", "UpDownCounter", "Histogram"]
        },
        "value": {
          "type": "number"
        },
        "attributes": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "key": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "value": {
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "type": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "enum": ["string", "bool", "int", "float"]
                }
              },
              "required": [
                "key",
                "value",
                "type"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "name",
        "value"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Responses

This adapter only replies with a payload on error.

## Examples

When running locally you can use `curl` and the CloudEvent examples in this section to test the adapter.

```console
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:8080  \
-H "content-type: application/json"  \
-H "ce-specversion: 1.0"  \
-H "ce-source: curl.client"  \
-H "ce-type: io.triggermesh.opentelemetry.metrics.push"  \
-H "ce-id: 123-abc" \
-H "ce-statefulid: my-stateful-12345" \
-d '[{
      "name":"total_requests",
      "kind":"Counter",
      "value":1,
      "attributes":[
        {"key":"host","value":"tm1","type":"string"},
        {"key":"type","value":"large","type":"string"}
      ]
    }]'
```

This example uses a `Counter` which value is meant to be added to the existing. Counters are non decreasing monotonics instruments.

```json
[
  {
    "name":"total_requests",
    "kind":"Counter",
    "value":1,
    "attributes":[
      {"key":"host","value":"tm1","type":"string"},
      {"key":"type","value":"large","type":"string"}
    ]
  }
]
```

This example uses an `UpDownCounter` which value is meant to be added to the existing. Counters can be increased and decreased by providing positive and nevative values respectively.

```json
[
  {
    "name":"quacking_ducks",
    "kind":"UpDownCounter",
    "value":2,
    "attributes":[
      {"key":"is_mulard","value":false,"type":"bool"}
    ]
  }
]
```

An `Histogram` provides data to be bundled into populations and aggregated.

```json
[
  {
    "name":"request_duration_ms",
    "kind":"Histogram",
    "value":52.1,
    "attributes":[
      {"key":"resource","value":"/job/process","type":"string"}
    ]
  }
]
```
